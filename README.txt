This lets you automatically fish in minecraft. It assumes your bobber will land roughly in the center of the screen and be surrounded by mostly water. This is very much a prototype, and you'll probably have to mess with it a little to get it working (for example, configure your resolution and the region the bobber is in). Unless you happen to be running this fullscreen at the default retina macbook pro resolution, in which case you're good to go!

Requires libpng and whatever else https://github.com/go-vgo/robotgo/ wants. In principle this is cross-platform, in practice I haven't tested.
